Hi Aakash here, i just started javascript with a simple project on TODOLIST.
The project will involve a TODOLIST that will have below features: 
*Show the full list items
*Add items in the list
*delete items from the list
*Quit the list 

How the list works?
#if the input is "list", the console will show the full list.
#if the input is "add", the console will add the item to the list.
#if the input is "delete", the console will delete the item from the list.
#if the input is "quit", the console will quit the session and prompt box will stop appearing.
